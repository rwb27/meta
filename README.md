Thank you for your interest in DocuBricks :tada:! 

## Background
We develop digital infrastructure to make the docu-mentation of Open Hardware in science easier and better. Check out our website www.DocuBricks.com for modular documentations!

DocuBricks is the centrepiece of our  initiative to develop open infrastructure for Open Science Hardware to flourish. The DocuBricks format is an open, modular documentation structure for high-quality presentation of open hardware projects. We are looking for contribu-tors for the website, rewriting the off-line editor for online use, help integrating the tool into partner platforms, improve user-interfaces, and mentor a diverse set of cool projects using DocuBricks. We are also involved in building a wider set of collaboration and publishing tools, to be used by the Journal and others.
